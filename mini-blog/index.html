    <h2>Why I Love Coding</h2>
    <p>Coding is like solving a puzzle. Itâ€™s <strong>challenging</strong> but rewarding when you see your ideas come to life. Whether it's building a website or a game, the possibilities are endless.</p>
    <p>Another reason I enjoy coding is the ability to <em>create something from nothing</em>. With just a few lines of code, you can build tools that help people in their daily lives.</p>
